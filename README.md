In the Assignments, PCA(Principle Component Analysis), LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis) were used. And in the project, we implemented four different machine learning models on a vegetable dataset in order to find the model that has the best performance, and the result being Resnet50+softmax as the final layer ends up having the highest accuracy.
